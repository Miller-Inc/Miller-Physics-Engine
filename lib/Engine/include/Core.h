/// Core.h
/// This file includes all the core engine types and utilities used throughout the project.
/// It serves as a central include file to simplify the inclusion of commonly used types
/// and utilities, such as strings, maps, arrays, vectors, images, and logging functionalities.
/// This helps to reduce the number of individual include statements needed in other files,
/// promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. By including this file, developers can
/// easily access the essential components of the engine without worrying about the specific
/// include paths or dependencies.
